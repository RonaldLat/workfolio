Experience up to 2x more effective Active Noise Cancellation, allowing you to block out distractions and focus on what matters most. Switch seamlessly between Transparency mode, which lets you hear the world around you, and Adaptive Audio mode for the perfect balance between awareness and immersion in any environment.

## Richer Audio Experience
At the heart of AirPods Pro lies the Apple-designed H2 chip, a technological marvel that enhances noise cancellation and delivers immersive sound quality. With custom-built drivers, users can enjoy crisp high notes and deep, rich bass, elevating their listening experience to new heights of clarity and definition.

No two ears are alike, which is why AirPods Pro come with four pairs of silicone tips in varying sizes (XS, S, M, L). Achieve all-day comfort and a secure fit with these tips, which create an acoustic seal to keep out noise and ensure AirPods Pro stay in place, no matter where life takes you.

## Dust, Sweat, and Water Resistance
Designed to withstand the rigors of daily life, both AirPods Pro and the MagSafe Charging Case boast IP54 dust, sweat, and water resistance. Whether you're hitting the gym or braving the elements, rest assured that your AirPods Pro will keep pace with your active lifestyle.

## Personalized Spatial Audio
Immerse yourself in sound that adapts to your unique ear shape, thanks to personalized spatial audio and dynamic head tracking. AirPods Pro deliver an enveloping listening experience that places sound all around you, while select songs, shows, and movies can be enjoyed in Dolby Atmos for a cinematic journey like no other.

## A Higher Level of Control
Manage playback functions effortlessly with touch controls located on the stem of AirPods Pro. Adjust volume, play/pause music, mute/unmute calls, and switch between listening modes with simple gestures, putting the power of customization at your fingertips.
